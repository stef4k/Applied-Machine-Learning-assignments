# Exploring the FEC 2016 Elections Data

Investigate the FEC elections 2016 data, go in more depth, and examine a different set of questions:
- Identify the top 5 Political Action Committees (PACs), or rather, super-PACs, that supported each of the two presidential candidates, giving the amount of money raised and spent by each one of them.

- Identify the top 10 individual donors (i.e., persons) for each of the two presidential candidates and the amount they spent. In order to do that, you should know that donations are not always to a fundraising committee that can be directly linked to a candidate, but they can be due to other entities such as PACs.

- Investigate the chronological evolution of the contributions made to and the expenditures made by the campaigns.

- Identify the biggest recipients of campaign expenditures.

- Examine the geographical distribution, at the state level, of campaign expenditures. For each state, calculate the expenditures per voter. This will require that you find a source with the number of registered voters per state. Examine the situation for swing states.

In order to answer the questions you will need to read carefully the documentation of the various files at the FEC web site. You may also need information outside FEC; make sure you document your sources. It is a good idea to do some background reading in campaign finance. Your answers will be marked based on both technical correctness and the quality of analysis and conclusions. Make sure your assignment reads well and include graphs where they help to make your point.
