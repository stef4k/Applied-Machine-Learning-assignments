# Exploring the Rosetta Stone of Human Capital

This assignment is about the working paper [A Rosetta Stone of Human Capital](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/rosetta-stone-human-capital), by Dev Patel and Justin Sandefur.

As known, there are different tests that measure reading and writing skills at school among countries in the world. The problem is that not all countries use the same tests. The basic contribution of the authors was to come up with a way to facilitate conversion between test scores in different countries. In this way they have created what they call a "Rosetta Stone of Human Capital", because it allows us to compare human capital across the different countries. The following tasks were executed:
- Study the relationship between income and the TIMSS and PIRLS score
- Explore how much years of schooling impact test scores, taking account of the per capita income
- Compare New and Previous Estimates
- Study the relationship between the skills of the people in each country and the value of its exports
